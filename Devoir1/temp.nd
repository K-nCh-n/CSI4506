| Monthly_Inhand_Salary            | - Mean/Median Imputation                                       | - The mean is affected by high outliers (max = 15,204.63); using the median (3,093.75) is more robust to skewed distributions.   |
|                                  | - KNN Imputation                                               | - KNN can capture relationships with other features, providing context-specific imputations.            |
|                                  | - Predictive Modeling                                          | - Regression can help predict salaries based on related financial attributes, enhancing accuracy.       |
| Num_Bank_Accounts                | - Mode Imputation                                             | - The mode reflects the most common behavior, which may be appropriate given the large count (17.09).  |
|                                  | - Mean/Median Imputation                                       | - If the distribution of bank accounts is not heavily skewed, mean or median can provide reasonable estimates.  |
| Num_Credit_Card                  | - Mode Imputation                                             | - Using the mode captures the most frequent number of credit cards, which is useful for categorical-like data. |
|                                  | - Mean/Median Imputation                                       | - If numerical behavior is significant, mean or median imputation can provide effective estimates.      |
| Interest_Rate                    | - Mean/Median Imputation                                       | - Given the high variability (std = 466.42), median (13) may be more representative and less influenced by outliers. |
|                                  | - Predictive Modeling                                          | - Other financial indicators may correlate with interest rates, making predictions more accurate.       |
| Delay_from_due_date              | - Mean/Median Imputation                                       | - Mean (21.07) or median (18) can effectively summarize typical delays, but assess for outliers.       |
|                                  | - KNN Imputation                                               | - KNN can use patterns from similar records to provide context-specific values for delay.              |
| Num_Credit_Inquiries             | - Mean/Median Imputation                                       | - This strategy can provide straightforward estimates; mean (27.75) could work if the data is roughly normal. |
|                                  | - KNN Imputation                                               | - KNN can capture relationships with other financial behaviors, providing more tailored estimates.     |
| Credit_Utilization_Ratio         | - Mean/Median Imputation                                       | - Given that this ratio is bounded (20 to 50), median (32.31) might be more representative due to its resilience to outliers.  |
| Total_EMI_per_month              | - Mean/Median Imputation                                       | - The mean is heavily influenced by outliers (max = 82,331), thus using the median (69.25) is more stable.  |
|                                  | - KNN Imputation                                               | - KNN can provide tailored estimates based on similar profiles, considering the relationship with other financial metrics. |
